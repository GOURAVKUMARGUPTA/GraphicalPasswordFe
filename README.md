# VisualCipher 

## Introduction
VisualCipher is a safer alternative system to traditional text-based passwords. Instead of typing in a word or phrase, users create a unique image or sequence of 
images as their password. This makes it much harder for hackers to guess or crack the password using automated software. Additionally, graphical passwords are easier
to remember and more difficult for someone to shoulder surf and steal the password. Lastly, users can create more complex passwords with graphical passwords since the 
the human brain is better at recognizing and remembering images than text.
